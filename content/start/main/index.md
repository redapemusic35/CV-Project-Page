  We have 4 hours total together, spread across two 2-hour sessions on two consecutive days. <br><br>
  Day 1: A GitHub profile, a `postcards` page, & a `distill` site <br><br>
  Day 2: A `blogdown` site using the new theme <br><br>
  You've been assigned to one of two sessions to attend both days: <br><br>
  <i class="fas fa-font ph1"></i> Session A: 8am-10am ET <br><br>
  <i class="fas fa-bold ph1"></i> Session B: 1pm-3pm ET<br><br>
  Where to start? [Prework!](/collection/prework/)
