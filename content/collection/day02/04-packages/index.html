<p>This post started as an exploration of different types of sentiment analysis. However, I ran into some issues using quanteda. Because of these issues, it occurred to me that I should probably do a post on Quanteda. Therefore, this is now a post using quanteda for text analysis, including sentiment analysis. It should be stated here, that I am largely following the tutorial at <a href="https://tutorials.quanteda.io/introduction/install/"><code>quanteda</code>’s home page</a>. Please go there to follow the tutorial because it is possible for some functions to change. This page is largely to remind myself of what packages I’ve used.</p>
<p>First, we are going to install the quanteda package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;quanteda&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>We will also need to load the following functions separately: <code>install.packages("quanteda.textmodels") install.packages("quanteda.textstats") install.packages("quanteda.textplots")</code></p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;quanteda.textmodels&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;quanteda.textstats&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;quanteda.textplots&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>We also use the <code>readtext</code> package to read in <code>txt</code> files.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;readtext&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Some of the tutorials we will look at are in the <code>quanteda.corpora</code> package.</p>
