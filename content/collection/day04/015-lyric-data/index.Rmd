There is an excellent little bit of code [over at](https://github.com/guoguo12/billboard-charts) written by Allen Guo which will retrieve song charts from Billboard.com. It used to be the case that you could also retrieve a list of all the charts as well but it looks as though the code on the website has been changed.
