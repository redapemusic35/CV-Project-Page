Mark Alfano maps the prevalence and interconnnections among the main topics and thesis of Nietzsche's philosophical writings as they develop over time by paying attention to to what he has to say about affirmation, agency, the ascetic ideal, drives, embodiment, emotions, the eternal recurrence, friendship, genealogy, health, history, inquiry, justice, life, nihilism, perspectivism, the self, the soverign individual, tragedy, value, virtue, and the will to power (composite map of semantic content).

Of these, what is the prevalence, association, and change at which each of the concepts above are expressed. 

* Through the use of computational approaches, we can analyze larger collections of documents for without making inferences about human behavior. (Rather, we are making inferences about the way a genre of music portrays human relationships. For instance; does it infer a nonchalant emotional tone about infidelity?). While Alfano is using texts and language to make inferences about the development of Nietzsche's main topics and thesis as they develop over time, we will be using texts and language to make inferences about the development of expressed emotions in literature over time. We will not be making any inferences about human behavior based on this analysis however.
* Additionally, we might want a way to highlight specifically those social contexts in which emotions are expressed in. One way to do this, is create a dictionary consisting of words denoting social contexts.

* Think about the other dictionarys we will need to use:
	* moral kind terms
