<p>“But what should we do with a fiction that is not blatantly false, but false only because an author has been forgetful”? (truth and fiction, 46) In other words, why can’t we ascribe the same subject-predicate form as parallel descriptions of real-life characters; such that it would be false to say “Holmes wears a silk top hat” in the same way that it would be false to say “Nixon wears a silk top hat.”</p>
<p>As it stands now, several difficulties arise in doing so:</p>
<ul>
<li>In some ways, Holmes is a real-life person of flesh and blood as is Nixon.</li>
<li>How many members are there in Sir Joseph’s chorus, <em>five</em>? <em>fifty</em>?</li>
<li>What restricts ranges of quantification.</li>
<li>Finally, why are fictional characters immune to inferred consequences?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>. . . the Meinongian must tell us why truths about fictional characters are cut off, sometimes though not always, from the consequences they ought to imply (37).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer to this question, argues Lewis is that we must first abstract away from the original to several of the possible revisions that remain closest to the original.</p>

<p>Thest Lets say that at <span class="math inline">\(w_{1}\)</span>, “Baker Street” is closer to “Paddington” than it is to “Waterloo.” Also at <span class="math inline">\(w_{1}\)</span> Sherlock Holmes has <span class="math inline">\(10^{5}\)</span> number of hairs on his head. While we might think that in the actual world <span class="math inline">\(w_{0}\)</span>, it is also true that “Baker Street” is closer to “Paddington” than it is to “Waterloo,” but this gives us no reason to think that Sherlock Holmes has <span class="math inline">\(10^{5}\)</span> number of hairs on his head. Therefore there are a number of truths <span class="math inline">\(\psi^{1-n}\)</span> which hold at <span class="math inline">\(w_{1}\)</span>.</p>

<p>The above is wrong because Sherlock Holmes does not appear to have <span class="math inline">\(10_{5}\)</span> number of hairs on his head. What this unfortunate sequence looks like is:</p>
