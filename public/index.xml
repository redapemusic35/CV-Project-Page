      <description>“But what should we do with a fiction that is not blatantly false, but false only because an author has been forgetful”? (truth and fiction, 46) In other words, why can’t we ascribe the same subject-predicate form as parallel descriptions of real-life characters; such that it would be false to say “Holmes wears a silk top hat” in the same way that it would be false to say “Nixon wears a silk top hat.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer This tutorial requires some experience with both python and R and the command line.
Some Basics     First, I should point out that much of the content in this section will be based on the book Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature by Matthew L. Jockers.
R and RStudio     There are at least two different kinds of environments that you can work with R in.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the Introducing Yourself Online workshop! We look forward to meeting you on Monday, January 25, 2021. Before attending the workshop, please complete the following prework.
Set up RStudio Cloud     Sign up for a free RStudio Cloud account at https://rstudio.cloud/ before the workshop. I recommend logging in with an existing Google or GitHub account, if you have one (rather than creating a new account with another password you have to remember).</description>

      <description>This story is borrowed from Paulina Sliwa (2012)’s Defense of Moral Testimony.
 Sam is standing at the shore of a lake when he sees a child beginning to drown. He believes that saving the child would be the good thing to do but it would involve ruining his new expensive suit. He cannot decide what to do and there is no one else at the lake, so he decides to call a friend whom he takes to be reliable.</description>

      <description>Once again, the purpose of this post is primarily for my own recollection. Here I will be using Hopp et al. (2021) extended moral foundations dictionary1 on the song More Hearts than Mine by Ingrid Andress. I’ve done other forms of sentiment analysis on this song in the past and I have never been too comfortable with the results. I think that this ought to be expected seeing as how this song does a great job in exploring the conflicting emotions someone might have in introducing a romantic interest to other relationships that one has a more extensive history with.</description>

      <description>Sarah and her fiance Sam are planning a wedding and both their families have agreed to contribute towards it. However, Sarah’s family is considerably less wealthy than Sam’s. Sarah’s family offered an amount that is less than half of the wedding costs and Sam and Sarah are wondering whether it would be fair to let Sam’s family pay more than Sarah’s. Initially they had wanted their wedding to be the envy of the three powers.</description>

      <description>The idea of emunah to daat I borrowed from Samuel Lebens in his delightfully interesting paper: Amen to Daat1: On the Foundations of Jewish Epistemology.
Silently, the massive imperial structure traversed the sky line, bathing the land below it in a void less mass, shapeless as it was, the shadow along the ground struck fear into its inhabitants, earth bound as they were, they knew, no rather they believed that there was no escaping the wrath of the mitrathi; that is until a whisper began to grow throughout their ranks: it is better to die on our feet, rather than live on their knees.</description>

It is important that you keep this file name. In Hugo, the home page is special- it gets special treatment. You can read more here: https://gohugo.</description>

      <description>Sometimes a person does the right thing without earning our admiration. Why do these agent’s actions prompt us to praise—or blame—when another’s would earn the opposite? Because deep moral concern, or its lack, is a signifying mark of a person’s character. In other words, the degree of someone’s moral concern is a distinguishing (representative) feature of that person’s character.
 The moral worth of an action is the extent to which the agent deserves moral praise or blame for performing the action, the extent to which the action speaks well of the agent.</description>

      <description>Cardie B. For instance, many argue that cardie b’s artwork is above reproach because it expresses freedom of expression etc and that it’s representative of a platform that allows her to be who she really is. Doesn’t force her into a box created by social constructs etc. However, there are two ways to look at this issue. On one hand, she’s being “herself” and that’s more admirable than portraying someone that isn’t really her.</description>

However, this assertion infers that the people are already Holy and therefore do not need to strive for Holiness by way of someone (Moses) who intercedes on their behalf.
