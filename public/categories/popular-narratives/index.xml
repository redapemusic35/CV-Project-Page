      <description>Cardie B. For instance, many argue that cardie b’s artwork is above reproach because it expresses freedom of expression etc and that it’s representative of a platform that allows her to be who she really is. Doesn’t force her into a box created by social constructs etc. However, there are two ways to look at this issue. On one hand, she’s being “herself” and that’s more admirable than portraying someone that isn’t really her.</description>
