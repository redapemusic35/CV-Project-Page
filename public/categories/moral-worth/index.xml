      <description>Sometimes a person does the right thing without earning our admiration. Why do these agent’s actions prompt us to praise—or blame—when another’s would earn the opposite? Because deep moral concern, or its lack, is a signifying mark of a person’s character. In other words, the degree of someone’s moral concern is a distinguishing (representative) feature of that person’s character.
 The moral worth of an action is the extent to which the agent deserves moral praise or blame for performing the action, the extent to which the action speaks well of the agent.</description>
