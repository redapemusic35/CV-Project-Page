      <description>Hopefully this will allow you to access course content quickly and easily. It is easier for me to maintain and you might have found that it was simply a click from Canvas. I will post the weekly assignments and lecture slides and notes from the previous week. The 5 numbers at the end of the links under &amp;ldquo;Lecture slides and notes&amp;rdquo; correspond to the Monday of the week&amp;rsquo;s lectures comprising that slide.</description>
