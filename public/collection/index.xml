      <description>Welcome to the Introducing Yourself Online workshop! We look forward to meeting you on Monday, January 25, 2021. Before attending the workshop, please complete the following prework.
Set up RStudio Cloud     Sign up for a free RStudio Cloud account at https://rstudio.cloud/ before the workshop. I recommend logging in with an existing Google or GitHub account, if you have one (rather than creating a new account with another password you have to remember).</description>

      <description>Iâ€™ve done this previously, namely I found a webscraper online, scrapped some lyrics from some sources, ran some text and sentiment analysis on them and declared that x music is more emotionally expressive than y music. I do sometimes worry about whether the numbers add up. Since then however, the sources have changed considerably and I was not able to use the code I had available to me at the time.</description>
