<p>There are at least two different kinds of environments that you can work with R in. Currently, the environment that I am using is a terminal <em>like</em> environment called vim. Vim works using a number of plugins and for my purposes, the main one is is Nvim-R. I am not going to recommend this if you do not have experience with it. Rather I will specify the basic method for getting started from scratch with no experience.</p>
<ol>
<li>To download the current version of <code>R</code> head to 
<a href="http://cran.at.r-project.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">R</a> and select on your operating system:
<ol>
<li>For <code>Linux</code>, choose distribution and installer file.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Download the &ldquo;Desktop&rdquo; version of 
<a href="http://www.rstudio.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RStudio</a>
<ol>
<li>Follow the installation instructions</li>
<li>Launch RStudio like any other program</li>
</ol>
</li>

<p>Ultimately, I am aiming to compare contextual sentiment expression across two genres of billboard music charts; namely Country and Hip-Hop R-n-B. To do this, it is helpful to identify a number of Billboard music charts that correspond to these styles. To do this, I&rsquo;ve found the <code>billboard.py</code> python api by 
<a href="https://github.com/guoguo12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allen Guo</a> to be central. 
<a href="https://github.com/guoguo12/billboard-charts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It can be found here</a>. It is merely an api that gives you access to 
<a href="billboard.com">Billboard.com</a>&rsquo;s music charts.</p>
<p>First, find a chart:</p>
<p><code>chart = billboard.ChartData('Hot-Country-Songs', year=2022)</code> selects a specific &ldquo;year end chart&rdquo; from Billboard.com which you can get 
<a href="https://www.billboard.com/charts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grouped by category here</a> and the 
<a href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end" target="_blank" rel="noopener">year-end charts from here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Next</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>create new file with an extension <code>.py</code></li>
</ol>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>touch billboard.py
</code></pre><p>Enter these contents:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>import billboard
import sys

chart = billboard.ChartData(&#39;Hot-Country-Songs&#39;, year=2021)

original_stdout = sys.stdout

with open(&#39;Hot-Country-Songs-2022.txt&#39;, &#39;w&#39;) as f:
    sys.stdout = f
    print(chart)
    sys.stdout = original_stdout

chart2 = billboard.ChartData(&#39;Country-Streaming-Songs&#39;, year=2022)

original2_stdout = sys.stdout

with open(&#39;Country-Streaming-Songs-2022.txt&#39;, &#39;w&#39;) as g:
    sys.stdout = g
    print(chart2)
    sys.stdout = original2_stdout
</code></pre><p><code>import billboard</code> imports the billboard api while <code>import sys</code> imports various python functions that will help to maintain different aspects of your python runtime environment.</p>
<p>Next, <code>chart = billbarod.ChartData('Your chosen chart', year=your chosen year')</code> saves the chart data, artist and song to the variable &ldquo;chart&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Then</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>with open(&#39;some text file.txt&#39;, &#39;w&#39;) as f:
    sys.stdout = f
    print(chart)
    sys.stdout = original_stdout
</code></pre><p>Here, you&rsquo;ve created a new file &ldquo;some text . . .&rdquo; and stored it as <code>f</code>, and printed the &ldquo;chart&rdquo; data to f and saved the chart to &ldquo;some text file . . .&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It should look something like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Country-Streaming-Songs chart (2021)
------------------------------------
1. &#39;Forever After All&#39; by Luke Combs
2. &#39;Tennessee Whiskey&#39; by Chris Stapleton
3. &#39;Starting Over&#39; by Chris Stapleton
4. &#39;Wasted On You&#39; by Morgan Wallen
5. &#39;I Hope&#39; by Gabby Barrett
6. &#39;Fancy Like&#39; by Walker Hayes
7. &#39;Whiskey Glasses&#39; by Morgan Wallen
</code></pre><p>In my particular case, I ran a number of regex functions in vim so that I would only have the title and name of the song left which I saved as a comma delimited file <code>csv</code> like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>I Hope,Gabby Barrett
The Bones,Maren Morris
Heartless,Diplo Presents Thomas Wesley Featuring Morgan Wallen
One Man Band,Old Dominion
10000 Hours,Dan + Shay &amp; Justin Bieber
Tennessee Whiskey,Chris Stapleton
Whiskey Glasses,Morgan Wallen
</code></pre><p>Briefly, it should be noted that you can retrieve as many charts as you&rsquo;d like with this code:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>import billboard
import sys

## chart 1, Hot-Country-Songs year-end 2021

chart = billboard.ChartData(&#39;Hot-Country-Songs&#39;, year=2021)

original_stdout = sys.stdout

with open(&#39;Hot-Country-Songs-2022.txt&#39;, &#39;w&#39;) as f:
    sys.stdout = f
    print(chart)
    sys.stdout = original_stdout

## chart 2, Country-Streaming-Songs year-end 2021

chart2 = billboard.ChartData(&#39;Country-Streaming-Songs&#39;, year=2021)

original2_stdout = sys.stdout

with open(&#39;Country-Streaming-Songs-2022.txt&#39;, &#39;w&#39;) as g:
    sys.stdout = g
    print(chart2)
    sys.stdout = original2_stdout
</code></pre><p>Each set will save a chart to a new <code>.txt</code> file</p>

<p>Retrieving music lyrics, I use 
<a href="https://github.com/johnwmillr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John W. Miller&rsquo;s</a> excellent lyrics genuis api which in turn gets the lyrics you want from the website 
<a href="https://genius.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">genuis.com</a>. The full instructions or its use can 
<a href="https://lyricsgenius.readthedocs.io/en/master/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">be found here</a>.</p>
<p>Before you use this package, you will need to sign up for an account to get access to the api. An account authorizes your access to the 
<a href="http://genius.com/api-clients" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genuis Api and can be done here</a>.</p>
<p>First, install the api from your terminal command line:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>pip install lyricsgenuis
</code></pre><p>Or get the latest version from 
<a href="https://github.com/johnwmillr/LyricsGenius" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github</a></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>pip install git+https://github.com/johnwmillr/LyricsGenius.git
</code></pre><p>For standard usage, see the website above. In my particular case, I had someone help me write this script and currently, as of today, it still works:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># import lyricsgenius
import lyricsgenius
# import csv python package of functions for handling csv files
import csv

# the first line gives you access to lyrics genius
genius = lyricsgenius.Genius(&#34;your api&#34;)

# artist and song list
here = &#34;your-saved-csv.csv&#34;
# file you will save lyrics to
there = &#34;new-lyrics-csv-file.csv (or .txt)&#34;

# open new-lyrics-file for writing to
directionsFile = open(there, &#34;+w&#34;)

# open artist song file to read from
with open(here, &#34;r&#34;) as source:
    reader = csv.reader(source)
    songartistlist = list(reader)

# Admittedly, it gets a little vague here, but I think that what is happening is that you create two sets of lists to save each of your columns to. The column on the left lists the song titles &#34;songlist = []&#34; while the one on the right lists the artist&#39;s name &#34;artistlist = []&#34;.

songlist = []
artistlist = []

# you then save the songartistlist as a variable called &#34;i&#34; each line is listed separately. Create a new variable called &#34;j&#34; where if an item (set of lyrics) is retured, then it is added to your object as a song

for i in songartistlist:
    count = 0
    for j in i:
        if count == 0:
            songlist.append(j)
            count += 1
        else:
            jsplit = j.split()
            j = jsplit[0]
            artistlist.append(j)

# while the additional (once again not utterly clear) will attach the song lyrics to the artist.

count1 = 0
songlyrics = []
for k in songartistlist:
    song = genius.search_song(songlist[count1], artistlist[count1])
    count1 += -1
    songlyrics.append(song.lyrics)

# save the lyrics file
directionsFile.writelines(songlyrics)

</code></pre><p>A quick mention is in order here. I cleaned up my original file. Since I am using Neovim, I was able to do this using a series of vim search and replace functions. Namely, there was a series of metadata variables such as <code>[Verse 1]</code> <code>[Intro]</code> highlighting the various verse blocks of the lyrics. using functions such as <code>%s /\[.*\]//gc</code> I was able to search these out can delete them. Further, each new song lyric began with <code>&quot;last lyric line of previous songEmbedSong title of new song followed byLyric&quot;</code>. It was pretty ugly. I replaced these lines like this: <code>%s /.*Embed\zeLyric/\[&amp;\]/gc</code>. I think that is what I did, if it doesn&rsquo;t work for you, you could always play around with various searches. Just do not close the file so that you can always recover.</p>
<p>I ended up with a file that began each new song lyric in this way: <code>[Song Title]</code>. I made a copy of the file and then deleted all of the song titles in the new copy. Although I no longer have the song title metadata in the file that I am working with, once I figure out how to record the metadata in a variable apart from the file I am working in, I can always do so.</p>
<p>One last change that I needed to make was a similar bit of housekeeping. My master file had a list of songs whose lyrics did not get included. These were not country song lyrics and I think that because of that, my script did not download the lyrics to these songs. I am not sure why they were there.</p>
<p>I now no longer have any metadata to contend with and after an extensive check, I was able to confirm that this is true.</p>
